# Brent Oil Price Change Point Detection

## Business Objective

The main goal of this analysis is to study how important events affect Brent oil prices. This will focus on finding out how changes in oil prices are linked to big events like political decisions, conflicts in oil-producing regions, global economic sanctions, and changes in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) policies. The aim is to provide clear insights that can help investors, analysts, and policymakers understand and react to these price changes better.

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive change point detection analysis for Brent crude oil prices from 1987-2022, identifying structural breaks in price patterns and correlating them with major geopolitical and economic events. The analysis uses both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to detect regime changes and quantify their impact on oil markets.
